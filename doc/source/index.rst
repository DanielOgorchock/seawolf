Seawolf Documentation
===================================

Seawolf is an underwater autonomous robot in development by the NC State
University `Underwater Robotics Club <http://www.ncsurobotics.org>`_ (or URC).
It is designed to compete in the `RoboSub <http://www.robosub.org>`_ autonomous
robotics competition, which is held in San Diego yearly around July.  The
competition consists of an underwater obstacle course that the robot must
navigate autonomously.
