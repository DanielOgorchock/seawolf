\section {Introduction} \label{introduction}
This handbook documents the software libraries, applications, and architecture
that has gone into the development of Seawolf's software. This handbook is
designed to document both how the software can be used, as well as documenting
how it works. 

\subsection {Organization} \label {introorganization}
The first major sections deal with using the Seawolf software. The first of
these sections is an overview of the software architecture to introduce the
components involved. Section two describes \libseawolf{}, the sub components of
\libseawolf{} and how to develop with it. The next section fully documents the
\libseawolf{} API and all the functions contained therewithin. Section five
covers the serial management applications with a focus on the serial
architecture. Section six describes the process of building and running Seawolf
applications.

The next sections are concerned with extending and modifying the \libseawolf{}
and serial management code. Of major interest includes adding new variables to
the SeaSQL component of \libseawolf{} and writing drivers for new serial
devices. Another section documents the Seawolf build system and may be important
to those extending parts of the Seawolf software stack.

A final section documents all Seawolf protocols and file formats.
