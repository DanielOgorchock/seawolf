\subsection{Seawolf Configuration File} \label{formatsseawolfconf}
This file is a single configuration file for configuring all components of
\libseawolf{}. The file is formatted as follows. Comments are ignored by the
parser and extend from a '\#' to the end of the current line. Whitespace is
ignored expect for newlines which separate records. Records are in the format
\bracket{option} = \bracket{value}. The following example configuration file
outlines all options and their possible values.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example Seawolf configuration file]
# Seawolf configuration file

# MySQL host
SeaSQL_hostname = localhost

# MySQL user name
SeaSQL_username = root

# MySQL database
SeaSQL_database = test

# MySQL password
#SeaSQL_password = 

# Use a server running on localhost for notify IO
Notify_method = net
Notify_server = localhost

# Replicate all logging messages to standard output
Logging_replicateStdio = true

# Debug logging level. One of debug, info, normal,
# warning, or critical
Logging_threshold = debug
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{SeaSQL Configuration File} \label{formatsseasqlconf}
Comments extend from a '\#' to the end of the line, white space is ignored
except newlines which separate records, and all values are unquoted ASCII
strings. All values are optional and default to the values in the following
example configuration file.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example SeaSQL configuration file]
# SeaSQL configuration file
hostname = localhost
username = root
database = seasql
password = 
port = 3306
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{\textit{NOTE}}: This configuration method is deprecated in favor of \inlinelink{apiseawolfconfig}{\func{Seawolf\_loadConfig}} and its corresponding configuration file documented in \interlink{formatsseawolfconf}{Seawolf Configuration File}.
